Autumn Escapes
<h2> Overnight Backpacking Trips Near SLC</h2>

<blockquote>Fall foliage, fewer crowds, and crisp air are just a few reasons to love hiking and backpacking in autumn. Whether you’re new to backpacking or a seasoned overnighter, these close–to–home destinations are perfect weekend escapes. When camping in fall, come prepared for cold nights and rapidly changing conditions to ensure a good experience. For the backpacking averse, these trips make great day hikes.</blockquote>

<h3>The Close to Home</h3>
<h4>Red Pine Lake</h4>
This trail starts off easy-ish and crosses a couple footbridges over creeks before inclining steeply through colored aspens and pines. Breaks in the trees offer dramatic down-canyon views of the Salt Lake Valley. Continue hiking to lower Red Pine Lake where ample campsites surround the glacial lake. If crowded, a less-defined trail to Upper Red Pine Lake offers a few campsites too.

Not tired yet? Hike to the summit of the Pfiefferhorn at 11,320 feet. This difficult trail features steep climbs, loose rocks, knife-edge ridges, and dramatic 360-degree views.

<h3>The Classic</h3>
<h4>Lake Blanche</h4>
One of Salt Lake’s best hikes; the trail to Lake Blanche is steep and scenic with gorgeous aspen trees changing to brilliant shades of orange and yellow this time of year. There are plenty of camping spots near the lake, just be sure to set up your site at least 200 feet from the lake as it’s a watershed. Overnighting gives you more time to explore lakes Lillian and Florence, or even take on the extra challenge of summiting 10,320-foot Sundial Peak.

<ul>
  <li><em>Getting There</em>: Located in Big Cottonwood Canyon at the bottom of the S-curve. Trail begins at Mill B Trailhead. Follow signs for <em>Lake Blanche Trail</em>.</l<em>Fees</em> <li>Fees: none</li>

  <li><em>Difficulty</em>: Moderate</li>

</ul>

<h3>The QUICKIE</h3>
<h4>Notch Lake</h4>
This mostly downhill trail passes four alpine lakes along the way: Clegg, Dean, Rieds, and Notch. It’s great for beginners as you can camp near any of the lakes along the way, making it as short or long a trip as you like. Notch Lake is the most crowded for camping, but is massive and offers great fishing, flat camping spots, and pre-built firepits. Or continue on to Bench Lake, but note that the trail steepens dramatically here so it’s not advised for beginners or those with young children.

<ul>
  <li><em>Getting There</em>: Found in the High Uintas, take Hwy 150 east for 29.1 miles from Kamas to the Bald Mountain Trailhead parking lot on the left. Follow sign to left for <em>Notch Mountain Trail</em>.</li>
  <li><em>Fees</em>: $<em>Distance</em>li>

  <li><em>Difficulty</em>: Easy</li>
  <li>Elevation Gain: -60<em>Dogs or Swimming Allowed</em>r Swimming Allowed: Yes</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Long Haul</h3>
<h4>Mount Timpanogos</h4>
The <em>Timpooneke Trail</em> features lush vegetation, a waterfall, abundant mountain goats, and gorgeous views. Start early (4 a.m.) to beat the crowds, or begin later if not summiting the first day. Prime camping spots are scattered along the way or in the large meadow below the peak.

Reaching the top of Timp—the Wasatch Range’s second highest peak at 11,572 feet—is tough in terms of steep, long climbs, but you won’t need to scramble to summit! A dilapidated shack marks the top, and the views of the valley here are unparalleled.

<ul>
  <li><em>Getting There</em>: For the Timponeeke Trailhead, drive up American Fork Canyon, take a right at the fork in the road and drive until you see a sign for the Timpoonee Campground. Take this road to a paved parking lot at the trailhead.</li>
  <li><em>Fees</em>: $6 cash</li>
  <li><em>Distance</em>: 15 miles RT</li>
  <li><em>Difficulty</em>: Strenuous</li>
  <li><em>Elevation Gain</em>: 4371 feet</li>
  <li><em>Dogs Allowed</em>: Yes</li>
</ul>
