<h3>PARK CITY</h3>
Vail Resorts is transforming Park City Mountain Resort and Canyons Resort this season with $50 million in upgrades, including connecting the two resorts to create Park City, the largest resort in the United States. The centerpiece of these extensive upgrades is the <em>Quicksilver Gondola</em>, an eight-passenger gondola that leaves from the bottom of <em>Silverlode</em> on the Park City side of the mountain and ends at <em>Flat Iron</em> on the former Canyons side. Lifts are being upgraded too, including <em>King Con</em>, a four-person lift that will be replaced with a six-person high-speed detachable chair. The <em>Motherlode</em> lift is being upgraded from a fixed-grip triple to a four-person high-speed detachable.

On the dining side, a new eatery called <em>Miners Camp</em> replaces PCMR’s Snow Hut next to the new Quicksilver Gondola. It includes 500 indoor seats and a top-of-the-line kitchen. On the former Canyons Resort side, <em>Red Pine Lodge</em> will be renovated to add 250 additional indoor seats. Additional snowmaking to account for gondola traffic rounds out the ambitious plan.

Park City also just launched <em>Epic SchoolKids</em> in Utah, which gives all Utah kids in Kindergarten through 5th grade five free days of skiing and riding at Park City. It includes a free lesson during the month of January as well. <a href="http://parkcitymountain.com" target="_blank">parkcitymountain.com</a>

<h3>SNOWBIRD</h3>
Tram riders will love 460-degree views at <em>Summit Lodge</em>, the new two-story glass enclosure facility at the top of Hidden Peak. Guests can dine and relax at 11,000' in the building which houses a coffee/pastry shop, cafeteria, Ski Patrol, and restrooms. There are almost 400 seats inside and a 10,000-square-foot outdoor deck.

<h3>SOLITUDE</h3>
Deer Valley officially took ownership in May and is planning a list of capital improvements, the most exciting of which is a new high-speed quad <em>Summit Express</em> chairlift to replace the current fixed-grip double chairlift. This provides quicker, easier access to Honeycomb Canyon, an in-bound area that skis like the backcountry. They also built a new run from the top of the <em>Apex Express</em> chairlift to the bottom of the new Summit Express, shortening the travel time to Honeycomb Canyon. Deer Valley is also revamping and remodeling the <em>Moonbeam Lodge Restaurant</em>, and completely updating the menus at all resort restaurants. <a href="http://skisolitude.com" target="_blank">skisolitude.com</a>
