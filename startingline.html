Utah Santa Runs
Get a jolly start to the holidays at timed Santa 5K Runs in Provo, Ogden, and Salt Lake City. Dressing as Saint Nick is required to participate, and a full Santa suit (hat, beard, jacket, pants, and belt) is included in your registration fee. Along the 5K courses, Santaâ€™s Helpers will hand out milk and cookies to aid the runners. The Salt Lake run takes place on November 21, Ogden Run is November 28, and Provo Run is December 5. Singing carols as you run is optional, but is sure to make the race more fun! <a href="http://runsanta.com" target="_blank3">runsanta.com</a>
