From the Editor

For those of us who love summiting peaks and skiing knee deep pow, venturing into Utah’s backcountry is a worthwhile risk. But when a sketchy situation escalates into a dangerous one, we must make the call: go on or turn back. Whether it’s skipping a summit when a storm is imminent or not skiing down a line that seems likely to slide, making smart, fast decisions is key to surviving and thriving in the outdoors.

A favorite story from this issue covers this topic as the author struggles with whether or not to climb Moab’s Ancient Art after a storm  (pg. 10). Then read on my favorite fall backpacking overnights near Salt Lake City (pg. 12) and get the details on local ski swaps (pg. 26) and ski resort updates (pg. 8). Read even more stories on our website <a href="http://sportsguidemag.com">sportsguidemag.com</a> and follow us on Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/sportsguidemag/" target="_blank">@sportsguidemag</a>.

Happy adventuring!
